# RandomDrawingMachine

A random drawing machine that accesses Facebook's Graph API to pull comments from a page specified by the API token. Comments and whatnot not included in repo because of privacy lol.

Initially built this to try and win a Nintendo Switch in a Facebook contest. I calculated that my friends and I eventually entered enough times to have a 50% chance of winning. We did not win.
